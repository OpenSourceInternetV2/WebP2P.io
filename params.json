{"name":"WebP2P","tagline":"The server-less signaling channel for WebRTC","body":"# WebP2P - Pure Javascript framework for Peer to Peer applications over WebRTC\r\n\r\nJesús Leganés Combarro \"Piranna\" - [piranna@gmail.com]\r\n\r\nWebP2P is a \"Peer to Peer\" filesharing framework written in pure Javascript\r\nmainly focused on the development of P2P filesharing applications. This project\r\nis also candidate for the [Universitary Free Software Championship]\r\n(http://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org/1213).\r\n\r\nIf you will fork the project (specially if you want to do modifications) please\r\nsend me an email just to let me know about your progress :-)\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nFile transfers in WebP2P is build over WebRTC PeerConnection [DataChannels]\r\n(http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/webrtc.html#rtcdatachannel) so they could\r\nbe transfered directly between peers, but since currently they are not available\r\nnatively it's necesary to use a [DataChannel polyfill]\r\n(https://github.com/piranna/DataChannel-polyfill). This makes it perfect for\r\nanonymity.\r\n\r\nLet's make a purely browser based, ad-free, Free and Open Source private and\r\nanonymous distributed filesharing system!\r\n\r\n## Mailing List\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to discuss P2P web applications further, send an email to \r\n\r\n> webp2p@librelist.com\r\n\r\nand you'll be part of the discussion mailing list! ([Archives here]\r\n(http://librelist.com/browser/webp2p/)).\r\n\r\n## How to test it\r\n\r\nThis library is part of the [ShareIt!](http://github.com/piranna/ShareIt)\r\nproject, so maybe you would interested in go directly there.\r\n\r\nThe peer connections are managed by an external handshake channel. Currently is\r\nbeing used primarily [PubNub](http://www.pubnub.com) and [SimpleSignaling]\r\n(https://github.com/piranna/SimpleSignaling) using a test server hosted on\r\nNodejitsu, but it's being researched to use some more standard and distributed\r\nhandshake protocols in an annonimous way so this single-point-of-failure could\r\nbe dropped.\r\n\r\nRegarding to the browser, it's recomended to use a high edge one. Test are being\r\ndone on Chromium v24 at this moment and currently it's the only officially\r\nsupported (news about it being used sucesfully on other browser are greatly\r\naccepted!!! :-D ). You can test it locally opening two browser tabs, but it\r\nshould work also if used between several machines (it was succesfully tested\r\nto transfer files through the wild Internet from Findland to Spain... :-) ).\r\n\r\n## External libraries\r\n### Handshake\r\n\r\n* [SimpleSignaling](https://github.com/piranna/SimpleSignaling)\r\n* [PubNub](http://www.pubnub.com)\r\n\r\n### Random utilities\r\n\r\n* [BoolArray.js](https://github.com/piranna/BoolArray.js)\r\n* [DataChannel-polyfill](https://github.com/piranna/DataChannel-polyfill)\r\n* [EventTarget.js](https://github.com/piranna/EventTarget.js)\r\n* [jsSHA](https://github.com/Caligatio/jsSHA)\r\n\r\n## Some related project\r\n\r\n* [WebRTC.io](https://github.com/webRTC/webRTC.io)\r\n* [bonevalue](https://github.com/theninj4/bonevalue)\r\n* [QuickShare](https://github.com/orefalo/QuickShare)\r\n* [ShareFest](https://github.com/Peer5/ShareFest)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nAll this code is under the Affero GNU General Public License.
